Building Your First Network
===========================

.. note:: These instructions have been verified to work against the
          latest stable Docker images and the pre-compiled
          setup utilities within the supplied tar file. If you run
          these commands with images or tools from the current master
          branch, it is possible that you will see configuration and panic
          errors.

The build your first network (BYFN) scenario provisions a sample Hyperledger
Fabric network consisting of two organizations, each maintaining two peer
nodes, and a "solo" ordering service.

Install prerequisites
---------------------

Before we begin, if you haven't already done so, you may wish to check that
you have all the :doc:`prereqs` installed on the platform(s)
on which you'll be developing blockchain applications and/or operating
Hyperledger Fabric.

You will also need to :doc:`install`. You will notice
that there are a number of samples included in the ``fabric-samples``
repository. We will be using the ``first-network`` sample. Let's open that
sub-directory now.

.. code:: bash

  cd fabric-samples/first-network

.. note:: The supplied commands in this documentation
          **MUST** be run from your ``first-network`` sub-directory
          of the ``fabric-samples`` repository clone.  If you elect to run the
          commands from a different location, the various provided scripts
          will be unable to find the binaries.
